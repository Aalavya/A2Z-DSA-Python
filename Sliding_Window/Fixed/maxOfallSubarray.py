'''
Given an array arr[] of size N and an integer K. Find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size K.

Example:
Input 1:
    A = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
    B = 3
Output 1:
    C = [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7] .

def maxSub_Array(a,b):
    # Part 1 >> we need to get a array and variable to store the max sum in the window 
    # Part 2 >> we need to check the max number in the current window 
    # Part 3 >> we need to store that 
    # Part 4 >> return all the max numbers once the entire array has been checked 
  
          
          
          
# Test Run 
print(maxSub_Array([1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7],3))
