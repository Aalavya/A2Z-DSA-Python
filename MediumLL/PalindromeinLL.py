Problem statement
You are given a singly Linked List of integers. Your task is to return true if the given singly linked list is a palindrome otherwise returns false.

For example:
The given linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2-> 1-> NULL.
It is a palindrome linked list because the given linked list has the same order of elements when traversed forwards and backwardâ€‹.
Follow Up:
Can you solve the problem in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity iteratively?

# Brute Force 
from collections import deque


def pali (head):
  
    stacki = deque()
    temp = head 
    while temp is not None :
        stacki.append(temp.data)
        
        temp = temp.next 
    
    # Checking Palindrome 
    temp  = head 
    while temp != None :
        if temp.data != stacki.pop():
            return False 
        temp = temp.next 
        
    return True 

# Time Complexity of this code is O(2*N)
# Space Complexity of this code is O(N)
    


# Optimal Approach 
def isPali(head):
    
    # Edge Case 
    if head is None or head.next is None : 
        return False

Every Linked List Problem, if you can't do it in LinkedList format,
copy the data in list and now your question would become for an 
array, solve it.
