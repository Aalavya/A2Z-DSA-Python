Problem statement
You are given a singly Linked List of integers. Your task is to return true if the given singly linked list is a palindrome otherwise returns false.

For example:
The given linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2-> 1-> NULL.
It is a palindrome linked list because the given linked list has the same order of elements when traversed forwards and backwardâ€‹.
Follow Up:
Can you solve the problem in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity iteratively?

Every Linked List Problem, if you can't do it in LinkedList format,
copy the data in list and now your question would become for an 
array, solve it.
