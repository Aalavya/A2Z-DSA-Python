Problem Statement: Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.
Example :
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]

ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ Follow up: Can you sort the linked list in O(n logn) time and O(1) memory (i.e. constant space)? ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨ğŸš¨
